# lightning-starter

A basic starter project for lightning core using Vite for minimal configuration.

The main demo is a basic grid of Carousels, which should look familiar to anyone used to common streaming apps.

Navigation is done through the arrow keys on the keyboard as no mouse support has been implemented.

It is by no means meant to be used as indicative of best practices, nor is it meant to have an appealing design. The goal was to keep the code as minimal as possible so it can be digested quickly.

If there's enough interest and need, we could add some more examples here for common design problems.

This project is built using only Lightning Core, it was made by hand, not using their CLI, this was all in an effort to keep things as simple as possible, but it also reflects what we would likely do in practice when starting a new project.

Lightning also offers an SDK which includes some more utilities that you can use to build a full-fledged application. You can just roll your own utilities when you need them for things like routing, i18, accessibility, etc.

Lightning also has a UI library, which includes a few purpose built components you can sub-class or use directly.
